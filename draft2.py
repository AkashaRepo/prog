#Second revision of the walking game
#Instead of while loops, rooms will be defined by dictonaries containing all the relivant information about the room
#While the player is in the room, the game will display that rooms discriptive text, and allow the player to exicute comands specific to that room.
#Rooms can be added and removed without changing the overall code.
#Idealy the room database will be in a seperate file from the game's engine.
