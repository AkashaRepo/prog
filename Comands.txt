A list of possible commands and their use.


-Status
Status displays the current status of the spacecraft, it's modules, and it's current location.
The player can type 'status' at any time to see the status screen.

-Engage torch, engage drive, escape, evade
Used to move around, typing 'engage torch' 'engage drive' or any varation of 'engage torchdrive' will display a list of possible destinations. 
Typing escape or evade will immedately send the player to the node above the current one and can be used in an emergency to escape from danger.

The following verbs have target arguments, used without an argument will display a list of valid targets and prompt the user to select one numericly, used with a valid target the comand will immediately preform that verb on that target.

-Scan(target), 
Scan returns detailed information about the target using the ships various sensors. Sometimes using the scan comand will reveal hidden data that can be recorded by the record comand.

-Record(target)
Record is used to record various forms of data found by the player. Some data is being broadcast openly and can be recorded at any time, other data has to be discovered first using the scan comand.

-Analyze/Decyrpt (target)
Analyze or decrypt is used to process data collected by the record comand. Some data must be analyzed or decrypted to be of any use. For game purposes analyze and decrypt do the same thing so the comands can be used interchangably.

-Ping/Hail/Iluminate (target)
Used to probe objects with radar or comunicate with people. Used on another character will attempt to contact them, used on an inanimate object will track it with active radar. For game purposes Ping and Hail do the same thing so the comands can be used interchangably.

-Reply/send to(Target), Message(Target)
Used to comunicate with people once a common language has been established. This comand will be implemented in a much latter stage in the game so we shouldn't worry about it too much. Typing any varation of Send message to (target) or reply to (target) will prompt a list of dialogue choices.

-Kill/Laze/zap/destroy/intercept (target)
Used to shoot things with the ship's microwave laser. An action which can be offensive or defensive depending on the curcumstances. The Microwave laser cannot penitrate atmospheres and as such cannot be used to attack ground targets and is limited to short range.

-Jam/Spam/DOS/Hack (target)
Used to attack things with the ship's ECW suite. A universaly hostile action. Unlike the microwave laser, the ECW suite can be used against ground targets and from long range.
