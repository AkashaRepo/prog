# Experementing with diffrent writing styles. Two possiblities exist in my mind, a third person "You see such and such" style, and a more computer ish style in which raw data is delivered from the sensors and the player has to decide how to interprate it.

#Deep space, style A. This would be a block of text displayed as the player starts the game and whenever they travel into the deep space node. It would be composed of several strings which would be written so as to be modular. For instance the first sentence here says "Emerging from hyperspace" as if the player had just started the game, but if they were to return to this node later it would say something else reflecting that. Similarly if anything happened there might be other signs of life visible from this node.

-"Emerging from hyperspace You orbit high above an unremarkable G class star alongside three major planets and a multitude of other smaller bodies not worth mentioning. Asside from faint radio emissions comming from the second planet, you detect no signs of activity."


#Deep space, style B. This would be a series of lines displayed on after another when the player enters a node. Possibly with a very short delay between them. As with the other style they would change to reflect the current situation.
