Problems that need solving:
1. be able to pick up things you wouldn't expect, without being prompted
2. be able to use the items without being heavily prompted, in ways that are challenging and in more than one way/instance.
3. be able to navigate the game without only following prompts, be able to move back and forth between locations wihtout only relying on prompts.

I am solving problem 1

DESCRIPTION

map
player is in a room, doesn't need to move, there is nowhere to go.
The room has objects in it, which the player can pick up and combine together
to create items. that's all that happens.

objects
pencil, paper, needle, bowl, thread, soap

1. pencil + paper = drawing
2. needle + bowl = compass
3. needle + thread = shirt patch
4. needle + soap = soap sculpture
5. soap + pencil = sundial
6. soap + bowl = suds
7. soap + thread = deer scare

exclusions
if you make suds with the soap you can no longer use the soap.
everything else can be used infinitely in multiple ways.

Bonus
drawing + soap sculpture = artist reward
shirt patch + suds = homemaker reward
sundial + compass = survivalist reward
deer scare + soap sculpture = risk taker reward
